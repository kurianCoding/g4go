/*
   a code to represent the level order transversal of binary
   search tree
   binary search tree has the unique property that the left subtree
   has elements lesser(in some logical order) than the right subtree
   so this excludes some configurations of arrays.
   level order trasversal means transversing the tree level by level
   from leaf to root. So the root is the highest level, and both branches
   of the root are at the same level, each branch of this level is also at
   the same level.
